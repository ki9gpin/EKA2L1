     * \brief Custom data layout server.
     * 
     * This server provides access to custom layouts for apps and games.
     * 
     * Imagine your main screen on the phone. You can have 3 type of layouts for its: Completely 
     * no widgets, menu button at the middle of screen or, contact button and menu button at 
     * bottom of the scrreen. These layout are not hardcoded, but rather stores in a folder
     * with a plugin making them layout to work and layout reference for the phone to draw.
     * 
     * That's how CDL server does the job. It scans layout files in specific folder in each
     * drive, and then provide them to client when it's asked to.
     *
