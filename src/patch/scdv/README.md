This part of the project is the replacement for the screen driver comes with every phone (scdv.dll).

This project is neccessary to replace any references to communicate with the hardware through logical device driver,
and replace them with calls to emulator.

Because the implementation on Symbian OSS is licensed under EPL, this project reimplements all stuffs, hoping
to be faster.
